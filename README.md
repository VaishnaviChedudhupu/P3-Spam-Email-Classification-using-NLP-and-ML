# P3-Spam Mail Classification by using NLP and ML

<h1> Spam Email Classification</h1>

<p> Spam email classification using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) involves the automatic identification of unsolicited and potentially harmful emails. This process leverages various NLP techniques to analyze the content of emails, extracting features such as keywords, phrases, and metadata to differentiate between spam and legitimate messages. Machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, logistic regression, support vector machines, and neural networks, are trained on labeled datasets to learn the patterns associated with spam. The goal is to improve email security by filtering out spam, enhancing user experience, and reducing the risk of phishing attacks and malware. By implementing this technology, organizations can streamline communication and protect users from unwanted disruptions.</p>
